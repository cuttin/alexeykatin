Hello!

I am a modeler and data analyst. I focus on solving estuarine and coastal eutrophication problems by combining process-based models with Bayesian inference. I am actively using R software, even to create this website! </br></br>
I have recently earned a PhD degree from [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) (USA). I also obtained MSc from [Dresden University of Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/) (Germany) in 2015, and a BSc from the [National University of Science and Technology](https://en.misis.ru/) (Moscow, Russia) in 2009. </br> </br>
